Dynamic 2D Arrays + Prime Manipulation in C

This project contains two small yet educational C programs demonstrating:

    How to dynamically allocate and manipulate 2D arrays

    Basic string handling (custom strlen)

    Prime number detection and conditional modification of arrays

ðŸš€ What It Does
âœ… Part 1: 2D Array Addition

    Dynamically creates two 2D arrays (3x6) using malloc

    Fills them with sequential values

    Prints both arrays

    Computes and prints the element-wise sum matrix

âœ… Part 2: String Length + Prime Doubling

    Custom function to calculate string length (ignoring newline)

    Checks if elements in an integer array are prime

    If an element is prime, it doubles the value

    Prints the modified array
